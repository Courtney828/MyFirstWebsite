<h3 style= "color:blue;font-size:18px;">Android application and website</h3>
I've participated in a work integrated learning in my final year, where we were tasked to approach
companies that are not well advanced in technology ,so our role was to develop an android
application and a website that will ease things to the companies, As crunch solutions we
approached an NPO in Pretoria at tshwane child welfare so I was given a role of a secretarian to
make sure that all the documentation was done on time. We were tasked to present it also and they
would give us feedback ,we managed to score ourselves 86%
